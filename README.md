This project is a C++ implementation of **Ray Tracing In One Weekend** by Peter Shirley, a popular introductory guide to the principles of ray tracing. The program generates a ray-traced image by simulating the physical behavior of light interacting with surfaces in a 3D scene.

- **Multi-Threading Support**: To enhance performance, Iâ€™ve added multi-threading, allowing the image generation process to take full advantage of multi-core processors. This significantly speeds up the rendering time, especially for high-resolution images.
