# Ray Tracing In One Weekend

![Ray Tracing Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24a5df87-d639-48d6-9941-4d013d0454d6)

This project is a C++ implementation of **Ray Tracing In One Weekend**, a popular introductory guide to the principles of ray tracing. The program generates a ray-traced image by simulating the physical behavior of light interacting with surfaces in a 3D scene.

- **Multi-Threading Support**: To enhance performance, Iâ€™ve added multi-threading, allowing the image generation process to take full advantage of multi-core processors. This significantly speeds up the rendering time, especially for high-resolution images.
